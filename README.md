# All my Front End Creations are in this repository.
# 1. Drum Kit : This app is a simulation of a real life drum kit created using vanilla Javascript.
# 2. Numbers and Date Facts : This App lets you enter a date or a number and returns an interesting fact. In this app, Bootstrap style and vanilla Javascript has been used. And a Fetch API has been used to call a web API "http://numbersapi.com/".
